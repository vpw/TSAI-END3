# TSAI Assignment 7
## Description

'Pick any of your past code and:

    Implement the following metrics (either on separate models or same, your choice):
        Recall, Precision, and F1 Score
        BLEU 
        Perplexity (explain whether you are using bigram, trigram, or something else, what does your PPL score represent?)
        BERTScore (here are 1 (Links to an external site.) 2 (Links to an external site.) examples)
    Once done, proceed to answer questions in the Assignment-Submission Page. 

    Questions asked are:
        Share the link to the readme file where you have explained all 4 metrics. 
        Share the link(s) where we can find the code and training logs for all of your 4 metrics
        Share the last 2-3 epochs/stage logs for all of your 4 metrics separately (A, B, C, D) and describe your understanding of the numbers you're seeing, are they good/bad? Why?'
        
## Solution
I have used the following model from previous assignments.
TODO

## Metrics
### Precision, Recall, & F1 score
To understand these we need to understand the True positives, False positves, True negatives and False negatives, which are shown in the following Confusion matrix.
[

#### Precision

#### Recall
#### F1 score
