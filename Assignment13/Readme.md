# Assignment 13

* Go through [this notebook](https://github.com/aws-samples/finetune-deploy-bert-with-amazon-sagemaker-for-hugging-face/blob/main/finetune-distilbert.ipynb), change the dataset (to anything other than "Amazon Reviews Polarity Dataset").
* Record the whole step using any video capturing software (like OBS). 
* Upload the video on youtube (you can make it unlisted, but allow for embedding)
* Share the link to your YouTube video, and the GitHub link where I can see the code you used for training (move the notebook with logs from Amazon to Github)

# Dataset

I used the Huggingface GLUE SST2 dataset
